            <p id="content"> If you have worked with HTML or CSS already, e.g., <span>by working through these tutorials in order</span>, then you know 
                that text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box. </p>
            <p class="p1">It starts at the top left of the content area (or the top right, in the case of RTL language content), and <a href="#homef">lows 
                towards the end of the line</a>. </p>
            <p class="p2">Once it reaches the end, it goes 
                down to the next line and flows to the end again. This pattern repeats until all the content has been placed in the box. </p>  
            <p class="p3">Text content effectively behaves like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, and not creating 
                line breaks until the end of the line is reached, or unless you force a line break manually using the element.
